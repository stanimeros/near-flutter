# Near

Near is a social networking application refactored to a Flutter version. Originally created as part of my undergraduate thesis at the University of Macedonia, this app focuses on privacy using the Two Hop Privacy algorithm.

## Features

- **Google Authentication:** Secure login using Google accounts.
- **Friend Requests and Chats:** Connect and communicate with friends.
- **Profile Edit:** Customize and update your profile.
- **POIs from OSM:** Automatically downloads Points of Interest (POIs) from OpenStreetMap.
- **KNN Point Selection:** Picks a K-nearest neighbors (KNN) point near you to share as your location.
- **Privacy Settings:** Configure k-anonymity settings in your profile for enhanced privacy.
- **Geo Database:** Uses [`sqlite3_flutter_libs`](https://pub.dev/packages/sqlite3_flutter_libs) and [`flutter_geopackage`](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_geopackage) to create spatial tables in SQLite and perform spatial queries. The database loads very fast, with query times between 5-50 ms.

### Requirements

- Minimum SDK for Android: 26
- Minimum iOS version: 13
